# PyTorch-basics
A series of algorithms, and exercises made in an effort to learn PyTorch.  

# Contents 
- **A2C**: Advantage Actor-Critic
- **DDPG**: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
- **DQN**: Deep Q-Learning
- **SAC**: Soft Actor-Critic
- **SAC-ERE**: Soft Actor-Critic with Emphasizing Recent Experience 
- **TD3**: Twin Dueling DDPG

# TODO 
- Flesh out documentation across implementations or at least refer to SAC-ERE
- Standardize visualization
- Implement Îµ-greedy exploration in all cases
- Implmenent GAN
